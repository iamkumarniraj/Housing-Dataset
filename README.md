# Housing-Dataset
Prediction of House in the Banglore Region 


Price forecast for homes in Bangalore.

The goal of this research is to forecast house prices in Bangalore, India. The project makes use of machine learning algorithms to examine data on residential properties and forecast their costs depending on a number of factors, including location, amenities, and area.

Dataset 

The Bengaluru Home Pricing dataset, which includes information on more than 13,000 residential properties in Bangalore, was used for this study. The dataset contains data on a variety of factors, including location, amenities, number of bedrooms, baths, and balconies, as well as the overall size of the property. The dataset also contains the properties' corresponding prices.

Installation 

You must have Python 3 and a number of Python libraries installed on your system in order to execute the project. The Python package installer pip may be used to install these libraries. These are the necessary libraries:
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn

Usage

To use the project, you can run the Multivariate dataset HousePricePrediction .ipynb Jupyter notebook. The notebook contains all the code and documentation necessary to run the project.

The following sections make up the notebook:

Data Preparation, Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis : To get the data ready for analysis, this phase cleans and preprocesses it. Steps including deleting duplicates, dealing with missing data, and transforming category variables into numerical variables are covered in this section.the data is examined and correlations between various characteristics and the intended variable are shown visually (house price). To assist readers comprehend the facts, the section contains a number of figures and charts.

In order to increase the precision of the machine learning models, this component, known as feature engineering, develops new features based on the existing features. Steps including adding additional variables, scaling and normalizing data, and handling outliers are covered in this section.

Many machine learning models are trained on the data in this part, and their performance is assessed using a variety of measures, including mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared. Models including linear regression, Lasso, Ridge, random forest regression, SVR, and XGBoost regression are included in this section.

Conclusion: Based on the analysis and model results, this part enumerates the conclusions and suggestions.
